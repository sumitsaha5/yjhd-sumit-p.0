                        Naina Talwar is a medical student who feels like an outcast due to her introverted nature. An
                        encounter with an old classmate, Aditi Mehra, makes her realize that she wants more from life.
                        She makes an impulsive decision to follow Aditi on a hiking trip to the Himalayas in Manali.
                        During the hike, she renews her friendship with other former classmates, Kabir "Bunny" Thapar
                        and Avinash "Avi" Shiv. Bunny is a charmer whose dream is to wander and discover the world; he
                        has no interest in settling down. Avi is a playboy who is addicted to alcohol and betting.

                        Throughout the trek, Naina and Bunny grow closer and she falls in love with him. Meanwhile,
                        Aditi grows jealous as Avi flirts with another friend. Bunny and Naina realize that she has
                        feelings for Avi. At the end of the trip, Avi reveals that Bunny has been accepted into the
                        school of journalism at Northwestern University in Chicago. Naina realizes that love and
                        marriage have no part in his plans and remains silent about her feelings.

                        Eight years later, Naina has finished medical school and is now working in a clinic. Bunny works
                        as a videographer for a travel show on FOX Network and travels the world. He receives an offer
                        to become a host for a new travel show, which he accepts. He also receives a wedding invitation
                        from Aditi; she is marrying a wealthy engineer, Taran Khanna. Bunny comes to Udaipur for her
                        destination wedding, where Avi acts repulsive toward him since Bunny never bothered to stay in
                        touch.

                        Naina's feelings for Bunny grow once again, and he too finds himself attracted to her. However,
                        as she doesn't want to get her heart broken again, she avoids him. Bunny sees Aditi fighting
                        with Taran; she reassures him that it was because she wanted to slap Avi for splurging on booze
                        and poker while Taran paid off his debts. She says she has gotten over Avi and is much happier
                        with Taran. Bunny realizes that he feels the same way about Naina but sees her with another man
                        and feels jealous, causing the two to argue. Naina says she can't keep hanging out with him
                        because she will fall in love again and Bunny kisses her. They admit they love each other but
                        neither is willing to give up a career to follow the other. Naina decides that it's best they
                        forget each other and they share a tearful goodbye.

                        On the night of Aditi's wedding, Bunny leaves for Paris. At the airport, he realizes the
                        importance of what he is leaving behind and goes back home, where he reconciles with his
                        stepmother. On New Year's Eve, Naina, alone at home, receives a surprise visit from Bunny. He
                        turned down his dream job to be with her and proposes, but she fears that he might regret his
                        decision. Bunny counters that he is happy with her and wants to continue traveling â€“ but with
                        her, arguing that they can make a life together. Naina concedes, and they have a conference call
                        with Aditi and Avi. They all wish each other Happy New Year and the film ends with Bunny and
                        Naina embracing.
